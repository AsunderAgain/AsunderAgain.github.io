<p><h2>Release One: To Prompt Two</h2></p>
<p>Alistair rested his back against one of the strong oak trees outlining their camp, his eyes drifting mindlessly over the cozy fire that stood just several feet from him. Though the flame’s warmth mixing with the chilly Ferelden air made his aching brain want to drift off, he narrowed his eyes to maintain his focus. He quickly glanced up towards the shimmering moon, wondering and waiting for when his turn for the night watch was over.</p>
<p>	And as if the Maker had heard his silent plea for rest, he heard footsteps approaching behind his leader’s tent. He tensed at the realization that the footsteps could belong to one person… or the other. </p>
<p>	By the time the figure had ended her pace before the fire, he sighed heavily when he knew it was the <em>other</em> person. The only other person who rested in the back of camp, except her tent was so far off that it was hidden behind the trees’ embrace. </p>
<p>	Morrigan had her arms crossed, her cold yellow eyes turning to him. Alistair would’ve honestly mistaken her for some monster through the darkness if he hadn’t known of her beforehand. </p>
<p>	“My shift over?” he asked, leaning off of the tree. Morrigan shifted her feet until her body was facing him.</p>
<p>	“I believe so,” she replied blankly, her shoulders held high with shameless pride. Alistair was even surprised by the fact that she had turned to face him. He watched though as she turned away, her eyes darting back over the resting flames. Her black boots were shifting evenly in the pale grass, her ebony strands of hair sticking to her pale temples. He was clueless as to how a person could be so threatening just by their appearance. </p>
<p>	Even though he wanted to turn and run from the witch of the wilds until he was back in his comfortable tent, he felt a slight tang of sorrow for her. He could remember the odd glisten in her shifting eyes as her mother, Flemeth, had ordered her to leave with him and his leader. Even though they had only known each other for a long week, he felt as if he should say something. The ice between them wasn’t yet broken, and maybe he’d be able to save their already faltering relationship if he reached a hand out to her. </p>
<p>	So he inhaled, taking a step towards the witch before opening an awkward beginning to an awkward conversation. “So let’s talk about your mother, for a moment.”</p>
<p>	Morrigan’s head tilted upwards, a thin grin appearing under her plum-toned lips. “I’d rather talk about your mother.” </p>
<p>	Alistair cringed, wondering if she had heard him telling their leader about the littlest portion of his family issues. “There’s nothing to talk about. And besides, isn’t your mother a scary witch who lives in the middle of a forest? Much more interesting.”</p>
<p>	“To you, perhaps. You would find moss growing upon a stone interesting.”</p>
<p>	Alistair bit his tongue, yet he wasn’t surprised by her barb. If she was going to jab, then it would be fair for him to jab a bit as well. “You know what’s more interesting than that? Apostates. Mages outside of the Tower. That’s illegal, you know.” The warrior knew that Morrigan and her mother were both bearers of the arcane arts, especially after witnessing her mother shift into a dragon to carry him and his leader from the burning Tower of Ishal. He bit his tongue again to drive away the bleeding memory. </p>
<p>	“You did not read that in a book somewhere? I hope the small letters did not strain you overmuch,” she snarked, her grin growing until her white teeth were shining. Alistair didn’t feel his shoulders slouch. But he could feel something breaking in his mind. His will to continue the conversation. </p>
<p>	“Or… we could not talk about your mother. That works for me.”Alistair had turned to walk around the fire towards his tent, but he paused by her stifling cackle. His will to speak was seemingly rebuilt as her laughter rang through his ears. “Why do you always go on about how stupid I am? I’m not stupid, am I?”</p>
<p>	Morrigan’s short laughter paused, her brows furrowing at the acknowledgement that was he undoubtedly showing weakness. Sarcasm coated her tongue like poison. “If you need to ask the question…”</p>
<p>	“Because it hurts my manly feelings, you know. All <em>one</em> of them,” he slightly joked, trying his might to lighten the mood- though, he knew he was just trying to lighten his own mood. </p>
<p>	“Then I’ll be sure to write you an apology once this Blight is over,” she replied, her arms crossing tighter. The flames between them were beginning to die out, the crackle of wood turning softer. Morrigan leaned over to a squat before reaching her hand into the flames, waiting briefly as the flames began to regain themselves with her magic. </p>
<p>	“I was educated by the Chantry. I studied history. They don’t make stupid templars,” he responded, his tone making him wonder if he was pleading. He automatically wanted to flee from her at the thought, just leave her to tending the flames before she began her midnight watch. </p>
<p>	“Then I must have been mistaken. I’m very impressed,” she mumbled, her raven brows furrowing as she studied the growing flames furthermore. Alistair tightened his tanned hands into fists.</p>
<p>	“No you’re not. You’re not even listening to me,” he continued, his already pre-planned defeat still chewing at the back of his mind. </p>
<p>	“My, you are smarter than you look after all. Your Chantry must have been very proud.” His will to speak broke again. He had never wanted to quit a conversation so quickly before- minus the time when the Revered Mother asked him where his left sock had gone to and why his robes were on backwards. He grunted before continuing the guilty walk to his tent, the sound of the strengthening crackle of flame against wood drumming through his ears like the cackle the witch had projected just a minute ago. Alistair knew he’d eventually get her back for this, but his sleepy mind prevented him from developing a plan. Only for the moment. </p>
